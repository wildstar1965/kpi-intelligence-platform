"""Request and response shapes for the Copilot API.

Kept in the Copilot package rather than added to ``app.schemas`` because the
request model carries a security property specific to this endpoint: the client
sends *what it is looking at*, and every field of that is a hint to be re-resolved
server-side, never an authorisation or a fact. Keeping the model next to
``build_context`` -- the code that does the re-resolving -- makes the pairing hard
to miss.

Note what the request cannot express. There is no company field (the URL and the
membership decide that), no SQL, no filter, no tool selection, no system-prompt
override, and no way to supply a KPI value or definition for the model to trust.
The frontend can say "the user is looking at KPI X, version 3, on this date, at
the North row of the region breakdown"; it cannot say what X means, what it
measured, or whether that measurement was abnormal.

That last omission is the deliberate one. Every panel that opens this Copilot has
an actual, an expected value and a deviation on screen, and it would be natural to
post them along with the question. They are not accepted. A request that could
state the actual could state a false actual and have the model explain it as fact,
so the request carries coordinates and the figures are re-read from the run the
platform stored. One context shape serves every panel precisely because it
contains no panel's numbers.
