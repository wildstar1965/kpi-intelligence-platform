"""Proof that an explanation is a reading of stored evidence, and nothing more.

Three surfaces are under test here, and they share one claim: **every figure a
reader is shown was already measured and stored, by a component that was allowed to
measure it.** The explanation layer computes no KPI, reads no data source, and adds
no number of its own. So the assertions below are mostly of one shape -- take a
figure out of the prose, and find it in the row the engine wrote.

What each part proves:

*Monitoring* -- the dashboard counts stored rows and says so. Its verdict tiles sum
to the number of evaluations it counted, including any verdict from an older schema
that it refuses to fold into a current one; its note does not claim a scheduler this
version does not have; and one company's dashboard never sees another's runs.

*Result explanation* -- six sections, in a fixed order, whose numbers are the stored
run's own columns. The two flagging tests are reported separately, because a
movement can breach a business tolerance while sitting inside normal statistical
variation, and letting either imply the other would misdescribe the verdict. The
``facts`` block that lets a reader audit the prose is gated on the same permission
as the detection API's ``evidence``.

*Node explanation* -- the same discipline applied to one part of a movement, with
its share taken from the stored breakdown rather than recomputed. A reader scoped to
one region cannot obtain an explanation of another, whether they clicked it or typed
it.

*Findings* -- a person's written conclusion, stored beside the measurement, with the
anchor validated as strictly as an analysis of the same anchor. Statuses are the
three the platform defines; ``resolved_at`` is written when a finding is resolved and
cleared when it is reopened, because a resolution timestamp on an open investigation
would be an event that never happened.

And throughout: no causal language. The engine measures shares of a movement. A
share is a size, and this suite fails if the prose upgrades one to a cause.
