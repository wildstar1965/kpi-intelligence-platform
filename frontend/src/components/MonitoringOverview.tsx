/**
 * The monitoring overview: what has actually been evaluated, and what moved.
 *
 * One governed read — `GET /companies/{id}/monitoring` — and every figure on the
 * screen is a count of stored rows or a copy of one. There is no arithmetic here
 * beyond choosing a colour, no projection, and no placeholder standing in for a
 * real number: a company that has never run detection sees zeros and is told so,
 * which is more useful than a dashboard that looks populated.
 *
 * Two honesty rules the layout exists to serve:
 *
 *  - **It must not imply a scheduler.** There isn't one in this version. The
 *    server's own note says so and is rendered at the top rather than tucked into
 *    a tooltip, and "last evaluated" is the timestamp of the most recent stored
 *    run — so a company whose last run was in March reads March, not "monitoring
 *    active".
 *  - **Withheld is not zero.** The investigation figures arrive as `null` for a
 *    reader without `investigation.read`. Those readers get no findings strip at
 *    all, rather than one reading "0 open" — which would be a claim about other
 *    people's work that this reader is not entitled to and that may be false.
 *
 * Every movement row is a way in: the result it came from, and the investigation
 * that would explain it.
 *
 * The findings panel reads the same way. Its lines are headlines the server
 * assembled from stored detection runs — abnormal verdicts the engine reached and
 * wrote down — over a period this panel selects for itself, separately from the
 * tally window above it. Nothing on it is generated to fill the space: a quiet
 * fortnight says so, and a movement no one has broken down names no cause and
 * says why instead.
 *
 * Any of those rows can be opened into a Copilot summary. That summary is not
 * composed here and not composed by a model from what is on screen: the row's own
 * detection run is sent back to the server, which re-reads the stored evaluation,
 * whatever breakdown exists and the approved documents this reader may see, and
 * returns the labelled sections and the recommended actions it assembled from
 * them. This screen supplies the coordinates and nothing else — which is why the
 * summary is rendered by the same two components the Result page uses rather than
 * by anything local to monitoring.
