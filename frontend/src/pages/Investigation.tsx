/**
 * Investigation Center: a KPI moved — which part of the business accounts for it?
 *
 * One generalized workflow, driven entirely by what the KPI's own registration
 * approved. Nothing on this screen names a dimension, an entity or a table: the
 * dimensions come from `/investigation/dimensions`, the entities from
 * `/investigation/entities`, the drill path from the hierarchy each dimension
 * declares, and a company whose business is split by Branch → Service reads
 * exactly the same code as one split by Region → Product.
 *
 * Two entry points, deliberately kept apart:
 *
 * 1. **From a movement.** Pick a KPI and a date the platform already evaluated,
 *    and its stored movement is apportioned across the KPI's default dimension.
 *    Rank the parts, choose one, drill into the next approved dimension. The
 *    order is the KPI's own hierarchy, not the reader's — a guided descent, not a
 *    free jump between dimensions. This is the path an ABNORMAL verdict leads to.
 * 2. **Manual.** Pick a KPI, a dimension, optionally one entity, a date and a
 *    lookback. With no entity it lists the dimension's largest values and ranks
 *    contributors; with one it reads that entity alone and shows the engine's
 *    verdict for it. Naming an entity never triggers work on the others — nothing
 *    on this platform runs anomaly detection over every entity, on a schedule or
 *    otherwise, and an entity is judged only because someone asked for it.
 *
 * **The gate comes first.** Both paths are only open for a date detection already
 * analysed, which the server decides and this screen only reports. Until then
 * there is nothing to investigate: the movement being split is the one the
 * business saw, so a date with no stored run gets an instruction to run the
 * analysis rather than a breakdown of a number nobody has measured.
 *
 * Two things this screen is careful *not* to say:
 *
 * * **A share is not a verdict.** The largest contributor in a ranking is the
 *   largest contributor. It gets no status chip, no colour that means "bad" and no
 *   badge — in a breakdown the only status shown belongs to the KPI, carried
 *   through from detection. Contribution ranks; it does not judge. The one place a
 *   part carries a status is the single entity a person asked about by name, and
 *   that status is the detection engine's, in the detection engine's three words.
 * * **A share is not a cause.** The wording throughout is "accounts for" and
 *   "associated with". Nothing here establishes why.
 *
 * The arithmetic all happens on the server. This file formats numbers and draws
 * bars; it never computes a share, a movement or an expectation, because a share
 * recomputed in a browser would be a second answer to a question that already has
 * one. Method — the queries, the comparable dates, whether the KPI's parts even
 * sum — lives under an optional technical details area, never in the business view.

        The window, drawn. The chart answers "how has this been running?"; the rows
        under it answer "what exactly was it on Tuesday?" — two different questions,
        and a chart alone cannot be read to the precision a business decision needs.
        Both come from the same server-supplied points, so they cannot disagree.
